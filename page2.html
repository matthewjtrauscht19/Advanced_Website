	This is a picture of me playing basketball from sixth grade. I started playing in fifth grade and loved the game as soon as I started playing. I currently am on Damien High School's varsity team.

	 Baseball is my other sport I play. I have aspirations to play in college as well. I am on Damien's varsity baseball team as well. It is usually very hard to try to balance my scheudle as both are time comsuming. I am a left handed pitcher.

	 Music is my third love. I am a huge fan of music and spend my time sifting through various artists and genres to find new music. I am a huge Lil Uzi Vert fan and I love Travis Scott as well.
